🧠 Predictive Modeling with Explainable ML: A Structured Approach to Classification  
In this project, I perform an end-to-end supervised machine learning pipeline on a classification problem, highlighting both technical rigor and responsible AI practices.

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):  
I start with a thorough EDA to uncover patterns, anomalies, and distributions in the dataset. This includes visual and statistical techniques to understand relationships between features and the target variable.

🛠️ Feature Engineering:  
Applied standard preprocessing techniques including handling missing values, scaling, and transformation.

One-hot encoding for categorical features to prepare them for ML models.

Simple Feature generation to enhance predictive power.

🤖 Modeling:  
I experiment with a range of classical ML models:

- Linear Regression (as a baseline)

- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

- Decision Tree Classifier

- Random Forest Classifier

📊 Evaluation:  
Models are evaluated using multiple performance metrics:

- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

- Gini coefficient (as a measure of model purity)

- ROC-AUC curves and confusion matrices for comprehensive diagnostics

🌈 Model Explainability:  
To demystify model behavior, I use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for local and global interpretability, allowing for a transparent assessment of feature importance and individual predictions.

⚖️ Ethics & Bias:  
While analyzing model outcomes, I encountered ethical concerns—particularly surrounding sex/gender-based features. I observed potential bias in model predictions, raising questions about fairness and the ethical implications of including sensitive demographic attributes. I addressed these by auditing feature importance and outcome distributions by group
