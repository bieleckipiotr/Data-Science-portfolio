## Dataset Description

# üîç Synthetic Card Transactions - Fraud Detection Starter

Welcome to the Mastercard Hackathon starter dataset!

This synthetic dataset simulates credit card transaction activity including both legitimate and fraudulent events. Designed to mimic real-world structures, the dataset encourages entry-level exploration of fraud detection concepts.

## üî¢ What's Inside?

* transactions.json: 500,000 transactions in JSON format with complex structure (location, payment method, session data, etc.)
* users.csv: 20,000 users from Europe, each with detailed demographic and financial information
* merchants.csv: 1,000 European merchants, including behavioral and trust-related features

## üß† Suggested Starter Task

Build a machine learning model that classifies transactions as fraudulent (1) or legitimate (0). Your task is to train a model using the provided transaction, user, and merchant data, then submit predictions for a new batch of transactions.

Start by exploring:

* Temporal patterns of fraud
* High-risk merchants and regions
* Cardholder behavior anomalies
